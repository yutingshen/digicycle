## Usage

This SDK supports both running in the browser (with Webpack) and in Node.

(Code examples using `await` assume an `async` context.)

#### Installation
```shell script
# with NPM
$ npm install --save @hashgraph/sdk
# with Yarn
$ yarn add @hashgraph/sdk
```

#### Creating a client
```typescript
import {Client} from "@hashgraph/sdk";

// Create a Testnet client. To create a mainnet client use `Client.forMainnet()`
// or if using a custom network use `Client.forNetwork()`
const client = Client.forTestnet()
    // Set operator AccountId and PrivateKey
    //
    // The account ID can be a string, or nubmer, or an `AccountId` type and is used
    // to sign transcations and query payments built with this client. This example
    // uses "0.0.101" is used as the operator account ID.
    //
    // The private key can be a string or an `Ed25519PrivateKey` type which will be used
    // to sign transactions built with the client.
    //
    // The private key is used to sign the transactions, either encoded as a string
    // or as an `Ed25519PrivateKey` type 
    .setOperator("0.0.101", "...");

// To validate the network is up and the client can connect to it you can call 
// the `Client.ping()` method. If the network is up nothing will happen, if
// the network is down, or the client failed to connect to the network for some
// other reason then this call would throw an error.
await client.ping();
```

#### Checking your balance

```typescript
console.log('current account balance:', await AccountBalanceQuery()
    .setAccountId("0.0.101")
    .execute(client)
);
```

#### Sending a transfer

```typescript
// The first parameter to `addSender()` or `.addRecipient()` can be a number,
// a string, or an `AccountId` type. This uses "0.0.101" and "0.0.102" as examples.
//
// The second paramter is the amount and it can be either a `number` or a `bignumber.js`
// type
new CryptoTransferTransaction()
    .addSender("0.0.101", 10_000_000)
    .addRecipient("0.0.102", 10_000_000)
    .build(client)
    .execute(client);
```

#### Creating a new Account

```typescript
import { Ed25519PrivateKey } from "@hashgraph/sdk";

const privateKey = await Ed25519PrivateKey.generate();
const publicKey = privateKey.publicKey;

const tx = new AccountCreateTransaction()
    .setKey(privateKey.publicKey)
    .setInitialBalance(0)
    .build(client);

await tx.execute(client);
const receipt = await tx.getReceipt(client);
const newAccount = receipt.accountId;

console.log('new account: ', newAccount, 'public key: ', publicKey.toString(), ' private key: ', privateKey.toString());
```

## Running locally

Checkout the [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md) file to get started!

## Proxying from a browser

By default, you can specify which nodes you'd like to submit to, but this assumes that you're running in a server environment. If you're running from the browser, the SDK defaults to a gRPC proxy hosted by [myhbarwallet](https://myhbarwallet.com/) and the [LaunchBadge](https://launchbadge.com/) team. If you'd like to run your own proxy, please checkout the [PROXY.md](PROXY.md) file to get setup!
